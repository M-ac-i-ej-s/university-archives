When you picture mountain climbers scaling Mount Everest what pr
obably comes to mind are teams of climbers with Sherpa guides le
ading them to the summit equipped with oxygen masks supplies and
 tents And in most cases youd be right as 97 per cent of climber
s use oxygen to ascend to Everests summit at 8850 metres above s
ea level The thin air at high altitudes makes most people breath
less at 3500 metres and the vast majority of climbers use oxygen
 past 7000 metres A typical climbing group will have 15 people i
n it with an almost equal number of guides and theyll spend week
s to get to the top after reaching Base CampBut ultradistance an
d mountain runner Kilian Jornet Burgada ascended the mountain in
 May 2017 alone without an oxygen mask or fixed ropes for climbi
ngOh and he did it in 26 hoursWith food poisoningAnd then five d
ays later he did it again this time in only 17 hoursBorn in 1987
 Kilian has been training for Everest his whole life And that re
ally does mean his whole life as he grew up 2000 metres above se
a level in the Pyrenees in the ski resort of Lles de Cerdanya in
 Catalonia northeastern Spain While other children his age were 
learning to walk Kilian was on skis At one and a half years old 
he did a fivehour hike with his mother entirely under his own st
eam He left his peers even further behind when he climbed his fi
rst mountain and competed in his first crosscountry ski race at 
age three By age seven he had scaled a 4000er and at ten he did 
a 42day crossing of the PyreneesHe was 13 when he says he starte
d to take it seriously and trained with the Ski Mountaineering T
echnical Centre in Catalonia entering competitions and working w
ith a coach At 18 he took over his own skimountaineering and tra
ilrunning training with a schedule that only allows a couple of 
weeks of rest a year He does as many as 1140 hours of endurance 
training a year plus strength training and technical workouts as
 well as specific training in the week before a race For his rec
ordbreaking ascent and descent of the Matterhorn he prepared by 
climbing the mountain ten times until he knew every detail of it
 even including where the sun would be shining at every part of 
the daySleeping only seven hours a night Kilian Jornet seems alm
ost superhuman His resting heartbeat is extremely low at 33 beat
s per minute compared with the average mans 60 per minute or an 
athletes 40 per minute He breathes more efficiently than average
 people too taking in more oxygen per breath and he has a much f
aster recovery time after exercise as his body quickly breaks do
wn lactic acid the acid in muscles that causes pain after exerci
seAll this is thanks to his childhood in the mountains and to ge
netics but it is his mental strength that sets him apart He ofte
n sets himself challenges to see how long he can endure difficul
t conditions in order to truly understand what his body and mind
 can cope with For example he almost gave himself kidney failure
 after only drinking 35 litres of water on a 100km run in temper
atures of around 40Â°CIt would take a book to list all the races
 and awards hes won and the mountains hes climbed And even here 
Kilians achievements exceed the average person as somehow he fin
ds time to record his career on his blog and has written three b
